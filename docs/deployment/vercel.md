# Deploying to Vercel

You can deploy the QuickDapp Next.js app to Vercel by simply deploying from your Github repo within the Vercel dashboard. 

Vercel will only build the Next.js web app (thus excluding the background worker). This behaviour can be changed by editing the [vercel.json](https://github.com/QuickDapp/QuickDapp/blob/master/vercel.json) config file.
