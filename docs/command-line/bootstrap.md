# bootstrap

The `bootstrap` command initializes QuickDapp, and should be run once after dependencies have been installed.

It installs a Git hook which ensures your future commit messages adhere to the [conventional commits](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).

Example usage:

```shell
pnpm bootstrap
```
