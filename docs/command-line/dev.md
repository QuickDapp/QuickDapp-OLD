# dev

The `dev` command is responsible for:

* Running the Next.js dev server.
* Running the [background worker](../background-worker/index.md) dev server.
* Running development database management commands.

All of these commands operate using the **development** environment configuration as defined via the [environment variables](../environment-variables.md).

!!!
The servers are spawned as child processes of the CLI command script, with their [stdio](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-stdout-stdin-stderr-node-js/) mapping to the console.
!!!

## Next.js

```shell
pnpm dev web
```

This internally runs:

* Next.js dev server which watches for changes to your web app and reloads automatically.
* [GraphQL](../frontend/graphql.md) code generator which auto-generates Typescript bindings when your GraphQL schema changes.
* [Contract ABI](../smart-contracts/abis-and-addresses.md) code generator which auto-regenerates the JSON ABI for your contracts when ABI config changes.

The website will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Background worker

```shell
pnpm dev worker
```

This internally runs:

* Node.js process for the background worker which auto-restarts when changes are made to the worker code.
* Code generator which auto-generates Typescript exports when a background job is added or modified.

##Â Running servers simultaneously

To run both the the Next.js and background worker servers simultaneously:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

## Database management

To migrate the database to the latest schema:

```shell
pnpm dev db migrate
```

To reset the database to the latest schema and clear all of its data:

```shell
pnpm dev db reset
```

To re-generate the Prisma client and associated Typescript bindings:

```shell
pnpm dev db generate-types
```
